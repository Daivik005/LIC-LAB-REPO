## Astable Multivibrator

- An astable multivibrator is an oscillator circuit that continuously switches between two states without any external triggering.

- It produces a square wave output, making it ideal for clock pulses, timers, and waveform generators.

- The circuit is inherently unstable in both states, hence the name astable.

- Typically built using two transistors, two capacitors, and resistors, or implemented with a 555 timer IC.

- The operation relies on capacitor charging/discharging through resistors, causing the transistors (or internal comparators in a 555 timer) to switch states.

- The frequency and duty cycle of oscillation depend on the values of the timing resistors and capacitors.

- No external trigger is required – the circuit is self-sustaining once powered.
