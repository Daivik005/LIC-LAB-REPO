Using the Formula for Power,
P=V*I
We will get the Values of Id as,
Id= 5.56 * 10^-5 A
Since we are using the 180n nmos, we are only changing the width to get the required current as output.

Result:

1. DC analysis
   For the dc analysis I kept the length as constant i.e, 180nm and kept the width to 198nm to get the required value of the current.


   




Inference

1.Current is directly Propotional to the Width of the Mosfet and the current varies with the change in width.

2.Mosfet saturation ensures the mosfet works as an amplifier and produces the desired negative gain as per the equation Av=-gm*Rd.

3.Q point stability is attained in saturation region thus helping in attaining linear amplification .

4.The Mosfet gain is increased in mid band frequency range (small signal analysis).

5.The Transient analysis reveleas the response of the circuit to time domain ssignal and determines how quickly the circuit responds to variation.

6.AC Analysis helps in designing circuits with desired gain and helps in impedance matching. Also helps in understanding the frequency response and small signal behaviour of the circuit.

Procedure

Design the CMOS amplifier circuit.

Naming the NMOS as CMOSN and PMOS as CMOSP.

Apply the DC voltage of VDD = 1.8 V

DC sweep Analysis: Go to the edit simulation command and select the DC sweep option and choose: -Source name= Vin. -type of Sweep= Linear. -start value=0, -stop value =VDD=1.8 V. -increment=0.1.

find the Vin from the vtc curve

DC Analysis:put the appropriate Vin value. go to the Simulate option and select Edit Simulation Command.

Click on DC Analysis, then press OK.Click on Run in the tab menu to obtain the DC operating point Vout .

Set the Length as constant and determine the Width such that ID = 55.5 uA .

Transient Analysis:Modify the Vin voltage source to a sine wave input with:

DC level= 0.9 V
Amplitude= 50 mV
Frequency= 1 kHz
In LTSpice, go to Edit Simulation Command, select Transient Analysis. Set the Stop Time as 5ms, then click OK.

AC Analysis:In Edit Simulation Command, select AC Analysis.Set the Type of Sweep to Decade.Set Points per Decade to 10.Set the Frequency Range from 0.1 Hz to 1 THz.Click OK. Determine the gain and frequency response of the circuit.
