Using the Formula for Power,
P=V*I
We will get the Values of Id as,
Id= 5.56 * 10^-5 A
Since we are using the 180n nmos, we are only changing the width to get the required current as output.

1. DC ANALYSIS:
Procedure for Performing DC Analysis: 

we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) in the Edit Simulation Command and Run the Simulation
Here are the simulation values

2. Transient Analysis:
Procedure for Performing Transient Analysis: we have to select the Transient Analysis in the Edit Simulation Command, Give the stop time as 1ms and Run the Simulation.

3. AC analysis:
   In the edit simulation we have to go to the ac analysis column and give the necessary constraints.
   Here is the graph for the result

Result:

1. DC analysis
   For the dc analysis I kept the length as constant i.e, 180nm and kept the width to 198nm to get the required value of the current.

2. Transient analysis
   




Inference

1.Current is directly Propotional to the Width of the Mosfet and the current varies with the change in width.
2.Mosfet saturation ensures the mosfet works as an amplifier and produces the desired negative gain as per the equation Av=-gm*Rd.
3.Q point stability is attained in saturation region thus helping in attaining linear amplification .
4.The Mosfet gain is increased in mid band frequency range (small signal analysis).
5.The Transient analysis reveleas the response of the circuit to time domain ssignal and determines how quickly the circuit responds to variation.
6.AC Analysis helps in designing circuits with desired gain and helps in impedance matching. Also helps in understanding the frequency response and small signal behaviour of the circuit.
