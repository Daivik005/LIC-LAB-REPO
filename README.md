Using the Formula for Power,
P=V*I
We will get the Values of Id as,
Id= 5.56 * 10^-5 A
Since we are using the 180n nmos, we are only changing the width to get the required current as output.

DC ANALYSIS:
Procedure for Performing DC Analysis: we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) in the Edit Simulation Command and Run the Simulation
Here are the simulation values
